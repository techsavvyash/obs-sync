# Action Plan for Obsidian Sync Service

## Overview
This project aims to create a custom sync service for Obsidian using Google Drive as storage, supporting multi-vault syncing with conflict resolution.

## Phases
1. **Setup and Research**
   - Research Google Drive API integration
   - Set up authentication and permissions
   - Define file structure for vaults

2. **Server Development**
   - Implement Elysia.js server
   - Add endpoints for file upload/download/metadata
   - Integrate Google Drive API for blob storage

3. **Plugin Development**
   - Create Obsidian plugin for change detection
   - Implement sync logic with server communication
   - Add conflict resolution UI

4. **Testing and Deployment**
   - Test multi-vault support
   - Validate file type handling
   - Deploy server and distribute plugin

## Key Considerations
- Security: OAuth for Google Drive access
- Performance: Efficient file change detection
- Compatibility: Support for desktop and mobile Obsidian
