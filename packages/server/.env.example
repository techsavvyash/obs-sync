# ==========================================
# DEPRECATED - SERVER NO LONGER NEEDED
# ==========================================
#
# This server has been deprecated and is no longer required.
#
# The Obsidian plugin now connects DIRECTLY to Google Drive
# without needing any intermediate server.
#
# This provides several benefits:
#   ✓ No server deployment required
#   ✓ No server maintenance needed
#   ✓ Better security (tokens never leave your machine)
#   ✓ Lower latency (direct connection to Google Drive)
#   ✓ Completely serverless architecture
#
# ==========================================
# HOW TO USE THE SERVERLESS PLUGIN
# ==========================================
#
# 1. Install the Obsidian plugin
#
# 2. Get OAuth credentials from Google Cloud Console:
#    - Go to https://console.cloud.google.com
#    - Create a new project or select existing one
#    - Enable "Google Drive API" for your project
#    - Go to "APIs & Services" → "Credentials"
#    - Click "Create Credentials" → "OAuth 2.0 Client ID"
#    - Choose "Desktop app" as application type
#    - Copy the generated Client ID and Client Secret
#
# 3. Configure the plugin:
#    - Open Obsidian settings
#    - Go to the Obsidian Sync plugin settings
#    - Enter your Google Client ID and Client Secret
#    - Click "Authenticate with Google Drive"
#    - Complete the OAuth flow
#
# 4. Start syncing!
#    - Your vault will sync directly to your Google Drive
#    - All files are stored in a vault-specific folder
#    - Tokens are stored locally on your machine
#    - No server involved!
#
# ==========================================
# MIGRATION FROM SERVER-BASED SETUP
# ==========================================
#
# If you were previously using the server:
#
# 1. Your existing data in Google Drive is safe and will work
# 2. Uninstall/stop the server - it's no longer needed
# 3. Update the plugin to the latest version
# 4. Configure OAuth credentials in plugin settings
# 5. Authenticate with Google Drive
# 6. Continue syncing as before!
#
# The plugin will recognize your existing vault files in
# Google Drive and continue syncing them seamlessly.

# This server code is kept for reference and local development only
